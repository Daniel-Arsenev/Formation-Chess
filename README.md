## How to play
### Rules
The rules are the same as regular chess, except for the following changes:  </br>

Neighboring pieces can perform a "formation" move, in which they move together.
For that they have to move the same amount of spaces in the same direction.
If one of the partial moves would be illigal by regular chess rules, that formation move is not possible.
A maximum of 3 pieces can be part of a formation move </br>

Special moves cannot be part of formation moves. This includes the initial double move of pawns, the en passant move of pawnes and castleing with king and rook </br></br>

### Controls

Click on single square or multiple squares with pieces on them to select them. You can then click on a square where they can move to or drag them to that sqare to make your move. All possible moves are shown to you by the dots visible after selecting your pieces. </br>

Clicking on the undo button in the lower left corner will undo the last move made
